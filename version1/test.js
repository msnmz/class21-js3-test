// VERSION 1

// 1.
// Write a function that logs to the console numbers 1 to 100.
// However, if the number is a multiple of 3 it should log to the console "This is a multiple of 3"
// If it's a multiple of 5 it should log "This is a multiple of 5"
// If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5 it should log "Jackpot!"
// Hint: use the modulo operator (%) to figure out if it's a multiple of 3/5. Make sure the remainder is 0, in order to pass the condition.
// Hint: the order of conditional statements is important!

// 2.
// Using JavaScript only (adding HTML to index.html is NOT allowed), create a button element (with text "click me!") and an empty image element and add it to the document.
// When the button is clicked, insert an image URL into the <img> tag and remove the button
// Use the following image URL: https://thehub.dk/files/5ad4b4a9f9ac4aa13c3d2d58/logo_upload-6d537cf7e5de664db275b32b3c6ae12d.png

// 3.
// Make an API call using the Fetch API or the regular XMLHttpRequest (whichever one you're more comfortable with).
// Use the following API: https://reqres.in/api/users
// Parse the response and then display the "first_name" and "last_name" of the first three users within the DOM (inside an unordered list)
